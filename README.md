# Simple Flutter App
This is a single screen flutter app that rolls two dices at the same time to produce random numbers.
You may use this app while playing board games as virtual dices. The primary purpose of this app is to act as a learning resource for those willing to learn Flutter for cross platform development.
It was built while I was taking a course by London App Brewery (LinkedIn Learning) on starting development with Flutter.
